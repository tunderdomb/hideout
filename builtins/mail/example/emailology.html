<!-- PARAGRAPHS -->
<p style="margin-top:0"></p>
<!--As stated above, paragraph tags are optional. Do not allow yourself to change the margin-top because it is not supported
in Outlook.com.  Paragraph padding is hit or miss in Outlook 2007/2010/2013.  You will have to stick to margin-left, margin-right, and
margin-bottom and avoid the generic "margin" property -->

<!-- TEXT LINKS  -->
<a href="http://www.emailonacid.html" style="color:#F00" target ="_blank" title="Email on Acid">Text Link Here</a>
<!-- Here, we've used inline css to overwrite Gmail's default link color. -->

<!-- EMBEDDING FILES -->
<a href="http://www.emailonacid.pdf" style="color:#F00" target ="_blank" title="Email on Acid">External File</a>
<!--If you have a client who asks you to include an attachment like a pdf, always recommend linking to an external file.
Attachments will often cause an email to be blocked by SPAM filters.-->

<!--INSERTING IMAGES-->
<img src="http://www.emailonacid.com/images/EOA_logo.gif" alt="Info Here" title="Info Here" width="308" height="58"
     style="display:block"  border="0"/>
<!-- Gmail, Yahoo and Outlook.com add in an extra space below images when using non IE browsers.  This is especially noticeable
when stacking images on top of each other.
A common fix is to add style="display: block".  Here are some more possible work-arounds:

It's best to use the "align" attribute vs. a CSS float if you are placing them inline with text - this is for Lotus Notes 6.5 and 7.
Image widths and heights need to be explicitly set and actual dimensions must be correct for Outlook 2007 and 2010.
The alt and title tags are equally important because a majority of email clients block images by default and instead display
either the title or alt text in the images' space.
Use border="0" to avoid unwanted outlines around your images in various clients - especially when wrapping a link around
the image.
Last but not least, you must always use absolute references to images in HTML emails:

<!--ORDERED AND UNORDERED LISTS-->
<table cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">•</td>
    <td>Test</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top">1.)</td>
    <td>Test</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<!--Outlook 2007/2010 converts your list items into paragraphs and spans (particularly if you use inline styles) so although
using tables is rather frustrating, it might save you time and hassle when testing lists. -->

<!-- BACKGROUND IMAGES -->
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" background="http://www.emailonacid.com/images/EOA_logo.gif" bgcolor="#006600"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<!--The "background" attribute within the TABLE, TH, or TD tag is the safest way to use background images.  This is supported
by all clients except Outlook 07, 2010, Lotus Notes 6.5, and 7.  For those, we added a "bgcolor" because Notes 6.5 and 7 have
limited support for inline CSS.
If you want to display a background image in the body of your email, create a wrapper table, width 100%.  Again, this is
because Gmail does not support embedded css and if it finds a background image in your inline CSS, it will ignore the entire
style declaration. To get background images working in Outlook 07 and 2010, check out this article courtesy of Campaign
Monitor and Brian Thies:

<!-- EMBEDDING VIDEO -->
<a href="http://www.emailonacid.com/free-email-test" target="_blank">
  <img src="http://www.emailonacid.com/images/widget_demo.jpg" alt="Online Demo" title="Online Demo" width="308"
       height="106" style="display:block;" border="0" />
</a>
<!-- HTML5 video is now possible in email, using a workaround we devised. Check that out here:

Or, you can use an image with play button and link it to the actual video. This is the usual method for including video.
For extra credit points, try embedding a linked GIF instead of a static image. -->
